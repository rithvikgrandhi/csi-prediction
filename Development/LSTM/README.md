# LSTM for CSI Prediction

## Overview
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict Channel State Information (CSI). Predicting CSI is crucial for optimizing the performance of wireless communication systems by adapting the transmission strategies based on predicted channel conditions.


## LSTM Architecture
LSTMs are designed to handle the sequential nature of CSI data, where the past and current state of the channel can provide insights into its future states. Below are the key components and equations that define the LSTM model used in this project.

### LSTM Equations
1. **Forget Gate**:
   - Determines parts of the cell state to discard.
   - `f_t = sigma(W_f * [h_(t-1), x_t] + b_f)`
     - Where `sigma` denotes the sigmoid function, `W_f` are the weights of the forget gate, `h_(t-1)` is the output from the previous timestep, `x_t` is the current input, and `b_f` is the bias.

2. **Input Gate**:
   - Decides which values to update in the cell state.
   - `i_t = sigma(W_i * [h_(t-1), x_t] + b_i)`
   - `C~_t = tanh(W_C * [h_(t-1), x_t] + b_C)`
     - Where `C~_t` represents the candidate values for state update, computed by applying a `tanh` activation function to ensure the values stay between -1 and 1.

3. **Cell State Update**:
   - Updates the cell state for time step t.
   - `C_t = f_t * C_(t-1) + i_t * C~_t`
     - Combines the past cell state `C_(t-1)` multiplied by the forget gate's output `f_t` (forgetting old information) with the input gate's output `i_t` multiplied by the candidate values `C~_t` (adding new information).

4. **Output Gate**:
   - Determines the next hidden state.
   - `o_t = sigma(W_o * [h_(t-1), x_t] + b_o)`
   - `h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)`
     - Where `o_t` is the activation of the output gate, controlling how much of the cell state to pass to the output, and `h_t` is the final output of the LSTM cell at time t.

### Model Details
- The model inputs CSI data from the past sequences to predict the future state of the channel.
- Each sample in the dataset represents a sequence of CSI measurements with multiple features per measurement.



## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted CSI and the actual CSI measurements. Further details and evaluation metrics can be found in the notebooks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
The LSTM model provides a robust framework for predicting CSI, aiding in the optimization of wireless networks. Future work could explore deeper architectures or hybrid models to further enhance prediction accuracy.
