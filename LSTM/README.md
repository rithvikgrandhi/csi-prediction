# LSTM for CSI Prediction

## Overview
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict Channel State Information (CSI). Predicting CSI is crucial for optimizing the performance of wireless communication systems by adapting the transmission strategies based on predicted channel conditions.


## LSTM Architecture
LSTMs are designed to handle the sequential nature of CSI data, where the past and current state of the channel can provide insights into its future states. Below are the key components and equations that define the LSTM model used in this project.

### LSTM Equations
1. **Forget Gate**:
   - Determines parts of the cell state to discard.
   - \( f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \)

2. **Input Gate**:
   - Decides which values to update in the cell state.
   - \( i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \)
   - \( \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) \)

3. **Cell State Update**:
   - Updates the cell state for time step t.
   - \( C_t = f_t \ast C_{t-1} + i_t \ast \tilde{C}_t \)

4. **Output Gate**:
   - Determines the next hidden state.
   - \( o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \)
   - \( h_t = o_t \ast \tanh(C_t) \)

### Model Details
- The model inputs CSI data from the past sequences to predict the future state of the channel.
- Each sample in the dataset represents a sequence of CSI measurements with multiple features per measurement.



## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted CSI and the actual CSI measurements. Further details and evaluation metrics can be found in the notebooks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
The LSTM model provides a robust framework for predicting CSI, aiding in the optimization of wireless networks. Future work could explore deeper architectures or hybrid models to further enhance prediction accuracy.
